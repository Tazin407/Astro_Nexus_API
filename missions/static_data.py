A trailblazing NASA mission will get some answers.When NASA's Lunar Trailblazer begins orbiting the Moon next year, it will help resolve an enduring mystery: Where is the Moon's water? Scientists have seen signs suggesting it exists even where temperatures soar on the lunar surface, and there's good reason to believe it can be found as surface ice in permanently shadowed craters, places that have not seen direct sunlight for billions of years. But, so far, there have been few definitive answers, and a full understanding of the nature of the Moon's water cycle remains stubbornly out of reach.",
